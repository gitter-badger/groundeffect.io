# Solo

Working by oneself, one is never truly alone. A social creatures we at least have our childhood and the panoply of companions and interlocutors. However, when it comes to work as well as creative production in general, there are certain advantages as well as constraints to working by oneself.

For one, solo work or solo production may be a mentality or personality issue. For others, creativity is a driving force that is individual and which can be painful to compromise.
